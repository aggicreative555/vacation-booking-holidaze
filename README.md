## Description:

Welcome to HOLIDAZE, a vacation booking website that's looks like it's right from a vintage postcard! Here you can be a viewer, customer and a venue manager. You can view venues, log in, register and place booking requests and create, edit and delete a booking as a manager. This is an **SPA** application built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind** & **Zustand**. It features bookings, calendar, and checkout using the Noroff **API**. The project is built using modern JavaScript practices and deployed to Netlify.
